How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easy to see the chenges side by side. If the new code had a bug I 
    knew it had to be in one of the changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    This can save time if you realise that the you liked features from the older version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros is  that the commitss are meaningfull. The cons is that you might forget to commit
    and you have the responsibility of knowing where is a fgood spot to comit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The files are conected and so are the changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log allows you to see all the changes commited and giff dii allows
    you to see the changes  between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I dont have to worry if i break something because I can always restore to a previous version that was working


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to use git for all my projects even for essays, and music
    projects
