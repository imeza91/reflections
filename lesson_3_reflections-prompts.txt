When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  a remote repository is useful if you want to share your work with other people.
  Or if you want to acces it from other devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Maybe someone else can add something but you dont want it in your master branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Forks means to clone a github repository in to your own github repository. I think fork can
    be used if I want to make my own changes to a code but I am not allowed to make changes to
    the original. This is probably what is meant by open-source.

    Clones means to make a copy of the repository from github to your local computer.

    Branches is when your repository has different commit that you didnt want to
    save in the master branch. In the Lesson we made a easy-mode branch, which was
    just an easier version of the original(master) branch
