When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  a remote repository is useful if you want to share your work with other people.
  Or if you want to acces it from other devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Maybe someone else can add something but you dont want it in your master branch.
