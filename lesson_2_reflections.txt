What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	a repository is created so that you can store your commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	I think in the staging area you are getting ready to commit. Also you might have made several changes in
	the working directory but the staging area allows you separate commits

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
		you should only stage what you want to commit even though your
		working directory has more changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	it can be used if you are happy with your current code but want to make
	a different version of your application. Or maybe you have 2 solutions to
	a problem and are not sure which one 2 take.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	They just do.
